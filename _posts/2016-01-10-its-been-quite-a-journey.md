It's Been Quite A Journey

**Expressing Myself**

Sketching stuff out is the same as thinking stuff through - for me anyway. I find I can think better when I can draw, sketch and scratch stuff on a pad or better yet a bloody big wall. Really big. I even went to Berlin recently to see one there. It just wasn't big enough.

And Then The World Became Visual

One of the side effects of new technology is that we now have screens everywhere. But we have far less time as a result. As we try to keep up with the increased promise of it all we need to keep more of our own promises. In order to buy back that time we need to literally make a picture speak a thousand words.

There's no time to ask people to read even 1% of what's available. It has to be images because they get to the brain in a meaningful way 60,000 times quicker than the equivalent in words.
